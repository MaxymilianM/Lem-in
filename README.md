# Lem-in
The main goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the labyrinth.  Ant colony moves from one point to another in the least amount of time. To complete this project I used graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search (BFS) and organized a queue.

This program will receive the data describing the ant labyrinth (map) from the standard output in the following format:
1) Count of ants.
2) Start room.
3)  Other rooms.
4) End room.
5) Links with all rooms that we have.
If the map is invalid, the program will display “ERROR”.

To start testing you need to write in console:
 “make all”.

Then execute a binary file using this command:
 “./lem-in  <  map”. 

You can find some maps in the folder named “maps”.
